    "text": "1.1 About Me\n\nHello !\nMy name is Bayram Saygili. Twelve years ago I graduated from civil engineering. I am currently working as an Project Specification Manager at Knauf, a German manufacturer of building materials.\nDue to my position, I have always collected various data with traditional methods(calling,e mail,visiting etc) and grouped them within the company in order to understand the needs of our customers for years. (This customer is working on interior design, the decision maker of this company is Mr. Ali. etc.)\nIn the last few years, the construction industry will have understood how important data is, and it has been putting pressure on sales teams to actively use CRM programs such as Salesforce. In particular, the digital transformation process of the company I work for inspired me in data analysis / data interpretation.\nFor this reason, I wanted to further my “data collection and interpretation” work that I have been doing for years on this subject. That’s why I’m here :)\nHere is my Linkedin profile"

    "text": "3.1 Alpiq: Keeping Hydroelectric Power Flowing\nSwiss energy company Alpiq wanted to optimize its short-term management of its hydroelectric power plants in order to improve efficiency and profitability. In order to achieve this, Alpiq needed a flexible and fast solution that could take into account the technical constraints of each plant, such as the number of available turbines and pumps, the number of hours each engine could run, and the volume of water in a dam.\nAfter testing a range of commercial and open-source solvers, Alpiq chose Gurobi Optimization due to its customization options, speed, and optimality. With Gurobi, Alpiq was able to optimize the performance of its pool of power plants by taking advantage of their synergies, and by better predicting the energy it needed to store and generate in the future.\nAlpiq also received support from the Gurobi team, which helped to ensure that the solver was set up correctly. In the future, Alpiq plans to use a solver to model various market processes and technical challenges in order to quickly respond to changing market conditions.\nPlease review the case study from the link."
